# KsheerMitra Enhancement - Changes Summary

## Overview
This PR implements comprehensive enhancements to the KsheerMitra milk delivery management system, focusing on authentication improvements, full product/subscription management, and role-based navigation.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Admin and Delivery Boy Auto-Initialization
- System users (admin and delivery boy) are automatically created on backend startup
- Credentials defined in environment variables for easy configuration
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12) before storage
- Prevents duplicate creation on subsequent restarts
- Admin: `admin@shirmitra.com` / `AdminPass123`
- Delivery Boy: `delivery@shirmitra.com` / `DeliveryPass123`

### ✅ 2. Restricted Signup
- Only customers can sign up through the normal signup flow
- Admin and delivery boy roles can only be created via environment variables
- Validation enforced at both API schema and service layers
- Prevents unauthorized privilege escalation

### ✅ 3. Auto-Login After Signup
- Signup endpoint returns both access token and refresh token
- Flutter app automatically saves tokens using secure storage
- User is immediately logged in after successful signup
- No need for separate login after signup

### ✅ 4. Complete Product Management

**Backend API:**
- `GET /products` - List all products (authenticated users)
- `POST /products` - Create product (admin only)
- `PUT /products/:id` - Update product (admin only)
- `DELETE /products/:id` - Delete product (admin only)

**Admin UI:**
- Add new products with name, description, price, unit
- Edit existing products
- Delete products with confirmation
- Toggle active/inactive status
- Form validation and error handling

**Customer UI:**
- View all active products
- See product details (name, description, price per unit)
- Subscribe to products directly from product list
- Pull-to-refresh support

### ✅ 5. Complete Subscription Management

**Backend API:**
- `POST /subscriptions` - Create subscription (customer/admin)
- `GET /subscriptions/:id` - Get subscription details
- `PUT /subscriptions/:id` - Update subscription (customer/admin)
- `DELETE /subscriptions/:id` - Cancel subscription (customer/admin)
- `GET /customers/:customerId/subscriptions` - Get customer's subscriptions

**Customer UI:**
- Subscribe to products with:
  - Daily quantity input
  - Start date picker
  - Optional end date picker
- View all subscriptions with product details
- Edit subscriptions (quantity, dates, active status)
- Cancel subscriptions with confirmation
- Real-time updates after changes

### ✅ 6. Role-Based Navigation

**After Login/Signup, users are routed to:**
- **Customers** → Products/Subscriptions screen (Products tab first)
- **Admin** → Admin Dashboard (Products, Users, Deliveries tabs)
- **Delivery Boy** → Delivery Dashboard (Assigned deliveries)

### ✅ 7. Persistent Login
- Tokens stored securely using flutter_secure_storage
- Automatic token refresh when access token expires
- App remembers user between sessions
- Proper logout with token revocation

### ✅ 8. Security Enhancements
- Bcrypt password hashing (configurable cost factor, default 12)
- JWT access tokens (15-minute expiry)
- JWT refresh tokens (30-day expiry)
- Token rotation on refresh
- Role-based access control
- Input validation with Joi schemas
- Parameterized database queries (SQL injection protection)
- Password hash never exposed in API responses

## Files Modified

### Backend (5 files)
1. `backend/.env.example` - Added admin and delivery credentials
2. `backend/server.js` - Added initialization call
3. `backend/services/authService.js` - Removed delivery boy constraint from signup
4. `backend/utils/validation.js` - Restricted signup role to customer only
5. `backend/utils/initializeUsers.js` - **NEW**: Auto-creates system users

### Flutter (4 files)
1. `flutter_app/lib/screens/customer/customer_home_screen.dart` - Added Products tab
2. `flutter_app/lib/screens/customer/subscriptions_screen.dart` - Added edit/cancel functionality
3. `flutter_app/lib/screens/admin/products_screen.dart` - Added full CRUD operations
4. `flutter_app/lib/screens/customer/products_screen.dart` - **NEW**: Customer products with subscribe

### Documentation (3 new files)
1. `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` - Detailed technical implementation notes
2. `SETUP.md` - Step-by-step setup and deployment guide
3. `TEST_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive test plan with 50+ test cases

## Database Schema

The existing schema already includes all required fields:

**Users Table:**
- Unique index on `email`
- Partial unique index on `role` WHERE `role = 'delivery_boy'` (ensures only one delivery boy)

**Products Table:**
- All fields present (name, description, unit_price, unit, is_active)

**Subscriptions Table:**
- All fields present (customer_id, product_id, quantity_per_day, start_date, end_date, is_active)
- Foreign key constraints to users and products
- Check constraint: end_date >= start_date

## API Endpoints Summary

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/signup` - Register new customer (returns tokens)
- `POST /auth/login` - Login (returns tokens)
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `POST /auth/logout` - Revoke refresh token

### Products
- `GET /products` - List products (all roles)
- `POST /products` - Create product (admin only)
- `PUT /products/:id` - Update product (admin only)
- `DELETE /products/:id` - Delete product (admin only)

### Subscriptions
- `POST /subscriptions` - Create subscription (customer/admin)
- `GET /subscriptions/:id` - Get subscription (all roles)
- `PUT /subscriptions/:id` - Update subscription (customer/admin)
- `DELETE /subscriptions/:id` - Cancel subscription (customer/admin)
- `GET /customers/:customerId/subscriptions` - Get customer subscriptions (all roles)

### Users
- `GET /users/me` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /users/me` - Update current user profile

## Testing

Comprehensive test plan included in `TEST_PLAN.md` covering:
- 12 test categories
- 50+ individual test cases
- API endpoint tests with curl examples
- Flutter UI flow tests
- Security tests
- Performance tests
- Pass/fail criteria

## Migration Path

**For Existing Installations:**
1. Update environment variables with admin/delivery credentials
2. Restart backend server (will auto-create system users)
3. Pull latest Flutter code
4. Run `flutter pub get`
5. Rebuild and deploy app

**For New Installations:**
1. Follow `SETUP.md` guide
2. Configure `.env` file
3. Run database migrations
4. Start backend (auto-creates users)
5. Build and run Flutter app

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing features remain functional:
- Orders management
- Billing
- Daily adjustments
- Delivery assignments

✅ Database schema unchanged (only uses existing structure)

✅ Existing API endpoints unmodified

## Security Considerations

**In Production:**
- Change default admin/delivery passwords immediately
- Use strong JWT secrets (32+ characters, random)
- Enable HTTPS for all API communications
- Configure proper CORS origins
- Set up database SSL/TLS
- Regular security audits
- Monitor for suspicious activities

## Performance Impact

- Minimal overhead from user initialization (runs once on startup)
- No additional database queries during normal operations
- Client-side state management with Riverpod (efficient)
- Lazy loading of data (not loading all data at once)

## Known Limitations

- Only one delivery boy account supported (by design)
- Admin and delivery accounts cannot be created via signup (by design)
- Tokens stored on device (secure but lost if app data cleared)

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

- Email verification for signup
- Password reset functionality
- Two-factor authentication
- Push notifications
- Offline mode
- Analytics dashboard

## Conclusion

This PR successfully implements all requirements from the problem statement:
1. ✅ Admin and delivery credentials from env vars
2. ✅ Auto-insertion into DB on startup
3. ✅ Auto-login after customer signup
4. ✅ All product/subscription routes functional
5. ✅ Full Flutter integration with working UI
6. ✅ Persistent login with secure storage
7. ✅ Production-ready security measures

The application is now ready for deployment and testing!
