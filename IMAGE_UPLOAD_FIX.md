# Image Upload Fix

## Problem
When uploading PNG/JPG images from the Flutter mobile app, the backend was rejecting them with the error:
```
Invalid file type. Only JPEG, PNG, GIF and WebP images are allowed.
```

## Root Cause
When image_picker on Android selects images, the MIME type is not always properly set in the multipart request. The backend's file filter was only checking the `mimetype` field, which was likely empty or incorrect.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix (upload.js)
Updated the file filter to check BOTH the MIME type AND the file extension:
```javascript
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  const allowedMimes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp'];
  const allowedExtensions = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.webp'];
  
  const fileExtension = path.extname(file.originalname).toLowerCase();
  const isValidMimeType = allowedMimes.includes(file.mimetype);
  const isValidExtension = allowedExtensions.includes(fileExtension);
  
  if (isValidMimeType || isValidExtension) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error(`Invalid file type...`), false);
  }
};
```

This ensures that even if the MIME type is not set correctly, the file extension will still allow the upload.

### 2. Flutter Fix (products_screen.dart)
- Added `mime` package to properly detect MIME types
- Explicitly set the content type when creating the MultipartFile:
```dart
final mimeType = lookupMimeType(imageFile.path);
final file = await http.MultipartFile.fromPath(
  'image',
  imageFile.path,
  contentType: mimeType != null ? MediaType.parse(mimeType) : null,
);
```

- Added detailed logging to debug the exact MIME type and file information being sent

## How to Test
1. Make sure you've run `flutter pub get` to install the `mime` package
2. Restart your backend server to apply the upload.js changes
3. Try uploading a PNG or JPG image from the Flutter app
4. Check the console logs to see the detected MIME type
5. The product should now be created successfully with the image

## Files Modified
- `backend/middlewares/upload.js` - Updated file filter
- `ksheermitra/pubspec.yaml` - Added mime package
- `ksheermitra/lib/screens/admin/products_screen.dart` - Added MIME type detection

## Additional Improvements
- Added comprehensive error logging in Flutter to show exact error messages from the backend
- Improved error messages to be more user-friendly with color-coded snackbars
- Backend now provides detailed error messages including both MIME type and file extension when rejecting files
