# ‚úÖ Implementation Complete: All Backend Features Now Visible on Frontend

## Overview
This document confirms that **ALL backend features are now fully visible and functional on the Flutter frontend**. The question "Any of the changes are visible on the frontend, did you change it or not?" has been definitively answered: **YES!**

## üìù Problem Statement
The project had a fully functional backend with admin, customer, and delivery boy features, but the Flutter frontend had placeholder screens that didn't expose all the backend functionality. The task was to make all backend changes visible on the frontend.
