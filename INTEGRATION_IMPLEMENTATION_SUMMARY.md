**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Flutter mobile app integration with the Node.js + PostgreSQL backend for the KsheerMitra milk delivery management system.

---

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. New Controllers

**File:** `backend/controllers/invoiceController.js`
- `generateMonthlyInvoice()` - Generate monthly invoice for customers
- `getCustomerInvoices()` - Retrieve invoice history

**Features:**
- Calculates total amount from delivered orders
- Generates PDF using existing invoice service
- Sends invoice via WhatsApp automatically
- Stores invoice record in database

#### 2. New Routes

**File:** `backend/routes/invoiceRoutes.js`
- `POST /api/invoice/monthly/:customerId` - Generate monthly invoice
- `GET /api/invoice/customer/:customerId` - Get customer invoices

**Security:**
- Rate limiting (10 requests per minute)
- JWT authentication required
- Input validation

#### 3. Updated Controllers

**File:** `backend/controllers/otpAuthController.js`
- Enhanced `updateProfile()` to accept latitude/longitude directly from Flutter
- No longer requires geocoding when coordinates provided

#### 4. Updated Services

**File:** `backend/services/otpAuthService.js`
- Modified `updateProfile()` to handle lat/lng from Flutter
- Falls back to geocoding if only address provided

#### 5. Updated Routes

**File:** `backend/routes/otpAuthRoutes.js`
- Added `/api/auth/send-otp` alias
- Added `/api/auth/verify-otp` alias
- Added `/api/auth/signup` alias for profile updates

**Reason:** Provide cleaner, more intuitive API endpoints for Flutter

#### 6. Updated Server Configuration

**File:** `backend/server.js`
- Added invoice routes: `app.use('/api/invoice', invoiceRoutes)`

#### 7. Fixed Sequelize Model Imports

**Files:** All models in `backend/models/sequelize/`
- Changed: `import sequelize from '../config/sequelize.js'`
- To: `import sequelize from '../../config/sequelize.js'`

**Models Updated:**
- User.js
- Product.js
- Subscription.js
- DeliveryStatus.js
- Invoice.js
- AreaAssignment.js

**Reason:** Corrected relative import paths after Sequelize integration

## Integration Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```
User → Flutter App → Request OTP → Backend → WhatsApp
                                       ↓
                                   Store OTP
                                       ↓
User ← Flutter App ← Verify OTP ← Backend
         ↓
    JWT Token Stored
         ↓
    Profile Setup (if new user)
         ↓
    Home Screen
```

### Delivery Boy Flow

```
Delivery Boy → Flutter App → Login with OTP → Backend
                                                  ↓
                                            Verify Role
                                                  ↓
Flutter App ← Get Assigned Customers ← Backend
     ↓
Google Maps Display
     ↓
Mark Delivery Status → Backend → Update DB
                          ↓
                    Send WhatsApp to Customer
                          ↓
End of Day → Generate Invoice → Backend → Send to Admin
```

### Admin Flow

```
Admin → Flutter App → Login with OTP → Backend
           ↓
    View Dashboard Stats
           ↓
    Assign Delivery Areas → Backend → Update Assignments
           ↓
    View Invoices
           ↓

## Security Enhancements

### Issues Fixed

1. **Rate Limiting Order**
   - Issue: Rate limiter applied after authentication
   - Fix: Applied rate limiter before authentication
   - Impact: Prevents authentication bypass in rate limiting

### Security Features

1. **Authentication**
   - OTP-based with WhatsApp
   - JWT tokens with 30-day expiry
   - Role-based access control

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - All endpoints protected
   - Different limits for different endpoint types
   - Prevents DoS attacks

3. **Input Validation**
   - Joi validation on backend
   - Flutter validation on frontend
   - Prevents injection attacks

4. **Path Traversal Prevention**
   - File path validation
   - Sanitization of user inputs
   - Prevents unauthorized file access

5. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Sequelize ORM with parameterized queries
   - No raw SQL queries with user input
