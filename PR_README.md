## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Image Upload for Products
**Problem**: Products couldn't have images uploaded  
**Solution**: 
- Backend already had multer middleware configured
- Images stored in `backend/uploads/products/`
- Frontend displays images with error handling
- Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP (max 5MB)

### 2. ✅ Product Screen Overflow
**Problem**: UI elements overflowing on small screens  
**Solution**:
- Optimized GridView with proper aspect ratio (0.7)
- Added BouncingScrollPhysics for smooth scrolling
- Wrapped widgets in Flexible to prevent overflow
- Text truncation with ellipsis

### 3. ✅ Multi-Product Subscriptions
**Problem**: Could only subscribe to one product at a time  
**Solution**:
- Enhanced backend validation to accept items array
- Created new `CreateSubscriptionScreen` with multi-select
- Schedule types: daily, weekly, custom
- Visual day selection for weekly schedules
- Backward compatible with existing single-product subscriptions

### 4. ✅ Product Card Button Logic
**Problem**: "Subscribe" button on all product cards  
**Solution**:
- Removed "Subscribe" from product cards
- Added "Order Now" button for one-time orders
- Added "Add to Cart" button (placeholder)
- Clearer separation of concerns

### 5. ✅ Subscription Screen Workflow
**Problem**: Unclear workflow for creating subscriptions  
**Solution**:
- Added prominent FAB "Create Subscription" button
- Complete guided workflow
- Multi-product selection interface
- Schedule customization UI
- View details for complex subscriptions
