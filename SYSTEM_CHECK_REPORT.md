## 1. Environment Variable Validation ✅

### Backend (.env)

All required environment variables are properly configured:

#### ✅ Required Variables
- `PORT`: 5000
- `NODE_ENV`: development
- Database configuration (PG_* variables)

#### ✅ Security Variables
- `JWT_SECRET`: Configured (not using default)
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: Configured for development (*)

#### ⚠️ Integration Variables
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Configured (placeholder for testing)
- `ENABLE_WHATSAPP`: false (disabled for testing)
- `ENABLE_CRON`: false (disabled for testing)

### Key Findings

✅ **Strengths:**
